# Simple-Calculator
This is a simple calculator web-app which I developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I've designed the UI using CSS such that it looks like a regular calculator. The calculator has options for doing all the basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Also it has options for calculating modulus and square of numbers
